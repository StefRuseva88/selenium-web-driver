## Interacting with HTML Elements

### 1.1 Form Input Automation
Automate form filling using Selenium by locating and interacting with various HTML elements. The process includes:

- Launching a web application.
- Navigating to the form.
- Populating input fields such as text boxes, radio buttons, and date pickers.
- Submitting the form.

### 1.2 Working with Web Tables

Web tables are represented by the `<table>` tag and are used to display data in a structured way.

**Steps:**

- Open the application using the provided URL.
- Locate the web table on the home page using XPath.
- Track the table to extract product data.
- Save the extracted information to a CSV file.
- Verify that the CSV file is created and is not empty by using assertions.

### 1.3 Drop-down Automation

Automate the interaction with dropdown menus using Selenium.

**Steps:**

1. Open the application with the given URL.
2. Identify the dropdown element by its `name` attribute.
3. Utilize the `SelectElement` class to access and interact with dropdown options.
4. Save the dropdown information to a text file.
5. Locate the file in the `bin -> Debug -> net{version}` folder.

## Data-Driven Testing

Implement data-driven testing to reuse the same test logic across different data inputs, thereby increasing test efficiency.

**Essential Concepts:**

- Data-driven testing decouples test data from the test logic, allowing the same logic to be applied consistently across various scenarios.
- Each test executes independently with its unique data set, which boosts the reliability of the tests.
